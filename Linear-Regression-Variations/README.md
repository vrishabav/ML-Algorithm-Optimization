```

## 📦 Installation & Dependencies

Python modules used: numpy, pandas, matplotlib

---

## ▶️ Running the Code

While running the code trough command line or using the notebook, make sure all the datasets (diamonds_train, diamonds_val and diamonds_test - which can all be installed from the Data folder) are in the same directory as the .py/.ipynb
(ensure all the modules mentioned in the previous section are also installed while running - a command has been included for the same in the ipynb)

### Command-line

Run this command first:
```pip install -q pandas numpy matplotlib```
Then after navigating to the directory which contains the datasets and the .py file:
```python3 da24b033_submission.py```
